# uniaud32
UNIAUD is a generic OS/2-eCS-ArcaOS MMPM audio driver that supports the vast majority of audio hardware. 
Uniaud32.SYS is the actual audio driver that connects to the hardware and makes it work. It consists of a modified ALSA core and some OS/2 specific pieces which make it load and run on an OS/2 system. Different major versions of Uniaud32 are based on different versions of ALSA.
